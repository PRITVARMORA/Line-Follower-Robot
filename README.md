# Line-Follower-Robot
   I have developed 2 different versions of line follower robots during the first year of my B. Tech to explore the ways to calibrate sensors and its performance. The whole robot is designed from scratch without using any direct external sources.

# Folder: Line Follower basic
   The developments file of line follower version 1 is stored in this folder.
   As line followers play an important role in automation, I have made this car to learn calibration of IR sensor and digital interpretation of sensor data (without using op-amp or MCU). The car simply designed to follow the white line on black background Using BJTs.

  The developments file of line follower version 2 is stored in this folder.
  The car is specially designed to follow any color of the line and it automatically gets calibrated according to it during initiation. Interchange of the color of line and background during operation would not affect its operation. It can detect line up to 90 degrees Turns.
